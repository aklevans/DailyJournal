# DailyJournal
This program is a digital journal that allows users to record daily journal entries. It is written in C# with .NET using WinUI.

On the home page, there is a text box that allows for the input of the daily journal entry. To finish the entry, click submit.
To view previous entries, click Read Journal. Only one entry per day is allowed, so if an entry already exists for the day,
the user will be given a prompt asking if they want to append their new entry to the end of the previous one or to replace the previous one. 

User journal will be stored in a file called Data.xml
